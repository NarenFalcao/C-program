Nokia : The reason behind the fall

Whenever you hear the word 'Nokia' , its logo with 'connecting people' pops out your mind. It's really hard to believe that the company which has established a solid market failed to proceed understanding the next generation mobile requirements. The hardware systems of nokia buffeted the other smartphones but failed to capitalise in software design leading to antipathy.

So why would Microsoft spend £4.6bn on a business that has lost its considerable market space?

Nokia devices despite of its industrial design, distribution or supply chain, lack an app ecosytem . So Nokia was considering going to Android or maybe even going out of business due to bankruptcy. Windows phone already been abandoned by other equipment manufacturers, had Nokia abandoned Windows Phone (by either going with Android or going out of business) , then that would be the end for Windows Phone.

The acquisition solves Nokia's problem. Indeed a tactical move by Microsoft.
